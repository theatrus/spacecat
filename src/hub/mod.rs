//! The centralized Chatstronomy hub service.
//!
//! The Hub accepts outbound Direct connections from N.I.N.A. plugins. One
//! hosted process owns the central Discord application, a
//! web app for login and telescope management, and the `/v1/direct`
//! WebSocket listener that N.I.N.A. plugins connect to.
//! All durable state lives in one SQLite database.
//!
//! See `docs/HOSTED_SERVICE.md` for the full design.
