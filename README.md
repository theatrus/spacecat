# Chatstronomy

Chatstronomy bridges N.I.N.A. with Discord and Matrix, including bot slash
commands for observatory control. The N.I.N.A. plugin reads the running profile
directly and either starts a private local chat runtime or connects outbound to
the hosted Hub.

## Choose a mode

| Mode | N.I.N.A. data path | Chat credentials |
|---|---|---|
| Hosted Hub | Plugin → encrypted WebSocket → [hub.chatstronomy.com](https://hub.chatstronomy.com) | Managed by the Hub |
| Local webhook | Plugin → current-user named pipe → bundled runtime | Discord webhook in the N.I.N.A. profile |
| Local bot | Plugin → current-user named pipe → bundled runtime | Discord application token/channel in the N.I.N.A. profile |
| Local Matrix | Plugin → current-user named pipe → bundled runtime | HTTPS homeserver login and room in the N.I.N.A. profile |

Every N.I.N.A. instance runs the plugin. Multiple instances, including ones on
different systems, can connect to one Hub account and be routed independently.
Local mode is intentionally machine-local; use Hub mode when several systems
must share a centralized Discord application.

## Install the N.I.N.A. plugin

Install **Chatstronomy** from N.I.N.A.'s plugin manager. Use the official plugin
repository when the release is available, or add the
[Chatstronomy development repository](https://github.com/theatrus/chatstronomy-nina-plugin)
to N.I.N.A.'s repository list for development builds. Restart N.I.N.A. after
installation, open **Options → Plugins → Chatstronomy**, and choose Hosted Hub or
a local delivery method.

The plugin captures native equipment, image, autofocus, guider, sequence,
cooling, wait, slew, center, and Target Scheduler state. Per-profile controls
choose which event families produce chat messages. N.I.N.A. popup notifications
are enabled by default; raw log levels are separately opt-in because logs can be
frequent and contain local equipment or path details.

## Run the Hub

The production path is [hub.chatstronomy.com](https://hub.chatstronomy.com).
Self-hosters can run the same service:

```bash
chatstronomy hub --hub-config hub.json --init
chatstronomy hub --hub-config hub.json
```

Edit `hub.json` after initialization to configure the public URL, Discord OAuth
application, bot token, signing key, bind address, and SQLite database. See
[docs/HOSTED_SERVICE.md](docs/HOSTED_SERVICE.md).

## Build and test

```bash
cargo build --release
cargo test --all-features
cargo clippy --all-targets --all-features -- -D warnings
```

On Windows the release artifact also contains the plugin-owned local runtime.
The plugin repository downloads that signed artifact, verifies its checksum and
signature metadata, and packages it with the N.I.N.A. plugin.

## Architecture

- `src/direct/` — versioned named-pipe and WebSocket protocol
- `src/hub/` — Hub server, authentication, routing, storage, and connected rigs
- `src/chat/` — Discord and Matrix delivery plus slash-command routing
- `src/chat_updater.rs` — state reconciliation and chat notifications
- `src/plugin_runtime.rs` — secure local runtime bootstrap from the plugin
- `contracts/direct/` — published Direct protocol fixtures

The Direct transport is outbound-only from N.I.N.A. and exposes semantic read
queries and typed commands. It does not open an observatory HTTP listener.
